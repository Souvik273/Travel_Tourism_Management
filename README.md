This is a desktop based application where one can view or book hotels and plan a trip according to their budget . To develop this project, I leveraged the power of Java, making use of Java Swing and AWT to craft an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. For seamless data management, I integrated JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to interact with a relational database using SQL, ensuring data integrity and 
efficient retrieval of information .
